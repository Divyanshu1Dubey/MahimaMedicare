INVOICE SYSTEM FIXES - SUMMARY

ISSUES FIXED:
1. ‚úÖ Pharmacist Profile URL Error - Added null check for pharmacist_id
2. ‚úÖ Duplicate Invoice Prevention - Enhanced invoice generation logic
3. ‚úÖ Missing Forgot Password URL - URL already exists at /hospital_admin/forgot-password/ (not .html)

INVOICE SYSTEM EXPLANATION:
Currently you have TWO invoice systems:

1. MEDICINE PURCHASE INVOICE (Razorpay System):
   - File: razorpay_payment/invoice_utils.py
   - Triggered: After successful medicine payment
   - Style: Professional GST invoice with logo
   - Location: Downloaded from patient billing tab
   - Features: GST details, company info, itemized billing

2. PAYMENT RECEIPT (Simple):
   - Shows transaction details
   - Basic payment confirmation
   - Less detailed than full invoice

RECOMMENDATION:
Keep only ONE invoice system - the GST invoice from razorpay system because:
‚úÖ Professional appearance with logo
‚úÖ Complete GST compliance
‚úÖ Detailed itemization
‚úÖ Company branding
‚úÖ Legal requirements met

INVOICE STYLING (Based on your request):
- Using the SECOND invoice's style (better colors/design)
- With FIRST invoice's details (complete GST info)
- Logo already added in previous update
- Professional color scheme maintained

DUPLICATE PREVENTION:
Enhanced the generate_invoice_for_payment() function with:
- Multiple duplicate checks
- Robust error handling
- Prevents multiple invoices for same payment

URL ACCESS CORRECTION:
The forgot password URL should be:
‚ùå Wrong: /hospital_admin/forgot-password.html
‚úÖ Correct: /hospital_admin/forgot-password/

FILES UPDATED:
- templates/hospital_admin/pharmacist-navbar.html (pharmacist profile fix)
- razorpay_payment/invoice_utils.py (duplicate prevention)

DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
Ready to commit and deploy these fixes.
