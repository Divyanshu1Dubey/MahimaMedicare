# 🎉 BUTTON FIX COMPLETED - MAHIMA MEDICARE

## 🔧 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED & SOLVED**

### ❌ **The Issue:**
You were getting a **404 Page Not Found** error when clicking the "Forgot Password" button because:

- The button was hardcoded to link to `forgot-password.html` 
- This file doesn't exist in Django (it should be a URL, not an HTML file)
- The link was: `<a href="forgot-password.html">Forgot Password?</a>`

### ✅ **The Fix:**
I updated the templates to use proper Django URLs:

**BEFORE:**
```html
<a href="forgot-password.html">Forgot Password?</a>
```

**AFTER:**
```html
<a href="{% url 'admin_forgot_password' %}">Forgot Password?</a>
```
