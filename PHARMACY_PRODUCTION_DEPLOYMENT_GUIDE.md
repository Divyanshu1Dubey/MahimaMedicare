### 🔄 **COMPLETE WORKFLOW SCENARIOS**

#### **Scenario 1: Online Payment Success**
1. Patient adds medicines to cart → HSN codes displayed
2. Proceeds to checkout → selects online payment
3. Razorpay payment gateway → successful transaction
4. Order confirmed → pharmacist receives notification
5. Pharmacist prepares medicines → updates status to "preparing"
6. Order ready → status "ready for pickup" → patient notified
7. Medicine dispensed → status "completed" → stock updated

#### **Scenario 2: Cash on Delivery (COD)**
1. Patient adds medicines to cart → HSN codes displayed
2. Proceeds to checkout → selects COD
3. Order confirmed with COD status → no payment gateway
4. Pharmacist receives COD order → prepares medicines
5. Patient arrives/delivery made → pharmacist collects cash
6. Payment collected → order status "completed" → payment status "paid"

#### **Scenario 3: Payment Failure Handling**
1. Patient attempts online payment → payment fails
2. Pharmacist sees failed order → chooses action:
   - **Option A**: Allow payment retry → customer tries again
   - **Option B**: Convert to COD → customer pays on delivery
   - **Option C**: Cancel order → stock restored automatically

#### **Scenario 4: Low Stock Management**
1. Order placed for medicine with low stock
2. System validates stock availability
3. If insufficient → error message, order blocked
4. Pharmacist gets low stock alert → restocks medicine
5. Customer can retry order with adequate stock

#### **Scenario 5: Home Delivery Process**
1. Customer selects home delivery → provides address
