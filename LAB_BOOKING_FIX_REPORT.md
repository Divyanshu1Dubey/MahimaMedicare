# Lab Test Booking System - End-to-End Fix Report

## 🩺 Issues Resolved

### 1. **Payment Amount Transparency Issue** ❌➜✅
**Problem**: Frontend displayed ₹500 but backend charged ₹520 due to hidden VAT
**Solution**: 
- Made VAT visible in frontend with breakdown: "₹500 + ₹20 VAT = ₹520"
- Updated JavaScript to calculate total including VAT
- Both frontend and backend now use consistent pricing

### 2. **Lab Worker Assignment Missing** ❌➜✅
**Problem**: Standalone tests weren't assigned to lab workers
**Solution**:
- Added automatic lab worker assignment during test booking
- Tests now create `Prescription_test` entries with `assigned_technician`
- Lab workers can see standalone tests in their dashboard

### 3. **Hardcoded VAT Configuration** ❌➜✅
**Problem**: VAT amount (₹20) was hardcoded in multiple places
**Solution**:
- Added `LAB_TEST_VAT_AMOUNT = 20.00` to settings.py
- Created `get_lab_test_vat()` utility function
- Updated all VAT calculations to use configurable value

### 4. **Payment Processing Error Handling** ❌➜✅
**Problem**: I/O errors during payment processing weren't handled gracefully
**Solution**:
- Added retry mechanism for Razorpay API calls
- Improved error messages for users
- Added fallback to COD when payment gateway fails

### 5. **Test Status Workflow Issues** ❌➜✅
**Problem**: Test status wasn't properly updated through the workflow
**Solution**:
- Added proper status updates: `prescribed` → `paid` → `collected` → `processing` → `completed`
- COD tests marked as `cod_pending` with proper status tracking
- Lab workers can track progress properly

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### Backend Changes (razorpay_payment/views.py)
```python
# Added VAT utility function
def get_lab_test_vat():
    return getattr(settings, 'LAB_TEST_VAT_AMOUNT', 20.00)

# Enhanced standalone test booking
- Automatic lab worker assignment
- Improved error handling for missing lab workers
- Proper test status updates
- Better exception handling
```

### Frontend Changes (templates/razorpay_payment/standalone_test_booking.html)
```javascript
// VAT transparency in pricing display
"₹500 + ₹20 VAT = ₹520"

// Updated JavaScript calculations
testPrices[id] = basePrice + vatAmount; // Include VAT

// Clear total display with VAT breakdown
"Total (including VAT): ₹520"
"Includes ₹20 VAT per test"
```

### Configuration Changes (healthstack/settings.py)
```python
# Lab Test VAT Configuration
LAB_TEST_VAT_AMOUNT = 20.00  # Fixed VAT amount per test in INR
```

### Model Updates (doctor/models.py)
```python
@property
def final_bill(self):
    from django.conf import settings
    vat = getattr(settings, 'LAB_TEST_VAT_AMOUNT', 20.00)
    return round(self.total_amount + vat, 2)
```

## 🎯 End-to-End User Flow (FIXED)

### 1. **Patient Books Test**
- Visits: `/razorpay/book-test/`
- Sees transparent pricing: "₹500 + ₹20 VAT = ₹520"
- Selects tests and payment method

### 2. **Payment Processing**
- Online payment: Razorpay charges exactly ₹520 (matches display)
- COD option: Marked as `cod_pending` for lab payment
- No amount discrepancies or surprises

### 3. **Lab Worker Assignment**
- Test automatically assigned to available lab worker
- Creates `Prescription_test` entry with `assigned_technician`
- Status set to `prescribed` initially

### 4. **Lab Worker Dashboard**
- Lab worker sees test in dashboard: `/hospital-admin/lab-dashboard/`
- Can track status: `paid` → `collected` → `processing` → `completed`
- Proper workflow management

### 5. **Payment Confirmation**
- Patient receives confirmation with correct amount
- Invoice generated with proper VAT breakdown
- Status tracking available in patient dashboard
