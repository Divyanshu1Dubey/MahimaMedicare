# 🎉 FORGOT PASSWORD LOGIN ISSUE FIXED!

## 🔍 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**

When you clicked "Forgot Password", you were getting redirected to:
```
http://localhost:8000/hospital_admin/login/?next=/hospital_admin/forgot-password/
```

This happened because the forgot password function had a `@login_required` decorator, which meant users needed to be **logged in** to reset their password - which defeats the entire purpose!

## 🔧 **ROOT CAUSE:**

**In `hospital_admin/views.py`:**
```python
@login_required(login_url='admin_login')  # ← THIS WAS THE PROBLEM
def admin_forgot_password(request):
```

This decorator forced users to log in before accessing forgot password, creating a catch-22 situation.

## ✅ **THE FIX:**

**Removed the `@login_required` decorator:**
```python
@csrf_exempt  # ← Only this remains
def admin_forgot_password(request):
```

Now users can access the forgot password page **without being logged in**.

## 🌐 **NOW IT WORKS CORRECTLY:**
