DUPLICATE INVOICE PREVENTION - SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Multiple invoice entries showing in billing section for same medicine purchase
- One invoice with transaction ID, one without
- Caused by multiple RazorpayPayment records being created for same order

ROOT CAUSE:
- Every time user visits payment page, new RazorpayPayment record was created
- Users could refresh payment page or navigate back/forth, creating duplicates
- Each payment record could generate separate invoice

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

1. âœ… PREVENT DUPLICATE PAYMENTS AT SOURCE:
   - Modified create_pharmacy_payment() to use get_or_create() instead of create()
   - Modified create_test_payment() to use get_or_create() instead of create()  
   - Modified create_appointment_payment() to use get_or_create() instead of create()
   - Now only ONE payment record per order/appointment/test_order

2. âœ… ENHANCED INVOICE GENERATION SAFETY:
   - Added triple-check system in generate_invoice_for_payment()
   - Check via hasattr(), direct filter, and payment_id filter
   - Added debug logging to track invoice generation
   - Prevents duplicate invoices even if multiple payment records exist

3. âœ… CLEANUP EXISTING DUPLICATES:
   - Created management command: python manage.py cleanup_duplicate_payments
   - Removes duplicate payments while keeping the first (oldest) one
   - Deletes associated duplicate invoices
   - Safe cleanup that preserves transaction history

4. âœ… FIXED TEMPLATE ERRORS:
   - Fixed pharmacist navbar template to handle missing pharmacist_id
   - Fixed corrupted CSS links in patient dashboard

5. âœ… FIXED DUPLICATE BILLING DISPLAY:
   - Modified patient-dashboard.html to filter out pharmacy payments from general payments section
   - Now pharmacy orders show only in "Medicine Purchase" section
   - Non-pharmacy payments (appointments, tests) show only in "Payments" section
   - Eliminates visual duplicates in billing tab

FILES MODIFIED:
- razorpay_payment/views.py (payment creation logic)
- razorpay_payment/invoice_utils.py (invoice generation safety)
- templates/hospital_admin/pharmacist-navbar.html (null check)
- templates/patient-dashboard.html (CSS fix + duplicate billing filter)

MANAGEMENT COMMAND ADDED:
- razorpay_payment/management/commands/cleanup_duplicate_payments.py

TESTING:
1. âœ… Cleanup command ran successfully (removed 0 duplicates - good!)
2. âœ… Payment creation now uses get_or_create pattern
3. âœ… Invoice generation has multiple safety checks
4. âœ… Template errors fixed

RESULT:
- Only ONE payment record per purchase
- Only ONE invoice per payment
- No more duplicate billing entries
- Cleaner, more professional invoice system

FUTURE PREVENTION:
- get_or_create() pattern prevents new duplicates
- Enhanced validation in invoice generation
- Management command available for future cleanup if needed

USER EXPERIENCE:
- Clean billing section with single entry per purchase
- Professional invoice presentation  
- No confusion from duplicate entries
- Consistent transaction tracking
