### 3. Sample Collection Process
1. Verify patient identity and order details
2. Collect payment (for COD orders)
3. Collect biological samples following protocols
4. Update order status to 'collected'
5. Store samples with proper labeling

### 4. Test Processing Workflow
1. Receive samples from collection team
2. Prepare samples according to test requirements
3. Run laboratory tests using appropriate equipment
4. Record observations and measurements
5. Update order status to 'processing'

### 5. Result Entry & Completion

2. Add units, normal ranges, and comments
3. Set report status (normal/abnormal/critical)
4. Complete test and generate report
5. Notify patient automatically via email

## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

The lab technician interface is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop computers (primary interface)
- Tablets (convenient for lab work)
- Mobile phones (emergency access)

## üö® Error Handling & Recovery

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Payment Collection Errors**:
- Validate payment amount before processing
- Handle network failures gracefully
- Provide manual payment recording option

**Sample Collection Issues**:
- Track sample collection status
- Allow re-collection if needed
- Maintain sample chain of custody

**Test Processing Problems**:
- Save partial results automatically
- Allow test restart if needed
- Escalate critical issues to supervisors

**System Integration Errors**:
- Graceful degradation when services are down
- Local data storage for offline work
- Automatic sync when connectivity resumes

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
```python
# Optimized queries for order management
orders = testOrder.objects.select_related(
    'user', 'user__patient'
).prefetch_related(
    'orderitems', 'orderitems__test'
).order_by('-created')

# Index optimization
class Meta:
    indexes = [
        models.Index(fields=['payment_status', 'created']),
        models.Index(fields=['user', 'ordered']),
    ]
```

### Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently accessed test information
- Session-based caching for user data
- Redis for real-time order updates

## üîç Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Order processing times
- Payment success rates
- Test completion rates
- Patient satisfaction scores
- Lab technician workload distribution

### Alerts Configuration
- High priority test delays
- Payment processing failures
- Equipment malfunction indicators
- Quality control issues

## üß™ Testing Procedures

### Pre-Production Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
python test_complete_lab_technician_workflow.py

# Load testing (using appropriate tools)
